## What is OrientDB?

**OrientDB** is an Open Source Multi-Model [NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) DBMS with the support of Native Graphs, Documents, 
Full-Text search, Reactivity, Geo-Spatial and Object Oriented concepts. It's written in Java and it's amazingly fast. 
No expensive run-time JOINs, connections are managed as persistent pointers between records. 
You can traverse thousands of records in no time. Supports schema-less, schema-full and schema-mixed modes. 
Has a strong security profiling system based on user, roles and predicate security and supports [SQL](https://orientdb.org/docs/3.1.x/sql/) amongst the query languages. 
Thanks to the [SQL](https://orientdb.org/docs/3.1.x/sql/) layer it's straightforward to use for people skilled in the Relational world.

## Is OrientDB a Relational DBMS?

No. OrientDB adheres to the [NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) movement even though it supports [ACID Transactions](https://orientdb.org/docs/3.2.x/internals/Transactions.html) and 
[SQL](https://orientdb.org/docs/3.2.x/sql/) as query language. In this way it's easy to start using it without having to learn too much new stuff. 


## Easy to install and use

Yes. OrientDB is totally written in [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) and can run on any platform without configuration and installation. 
Do you develop with a language different than Java? No problem, look at the [Programming Language Binding](http://orientdb.org/docs/3.1.x/apis-and-drivers/).
